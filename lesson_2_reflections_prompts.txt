Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. When we initialize a repository, a .git folder is created which stores 
all the metadata related to the project, which has the commit versions and
related details. It is needed so that we can store the commit versions helping
in efficiency.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. Staging area is used as an intermediary area to store all the 'improved'
files so that we can create a single commit depending upon the programmer, if he
thinks that multiple 'improved' files are required to be in a single new
commit due to various reasons(usually if the multiple 'improved' files have 
logical change but not significant enough). It offers a chance to the programmer
to review whether the files added in staging area are to be saved in a single
commit or not. It gives the programmer a chance to remove a file he doesn't
deem it worthy enough to have in the commit or save it in the next commit.
